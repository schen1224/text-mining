    <h1>Project Reflection</h1>
    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p>
      In this project, I used the data source from the book library- Project
      Gutenberg. Specifically, I chose two books by Arthur Conan Doyle-
      <i>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</i> and
      <i>The Returns of Sherlock Holmes</i>. The main objective of the project
      is to analyze the writing styles of Arthur Conan Doyle, similarity and
      differences. To achieve the objective, I first did some basic analysis to
      the text, including getting the total words, most common words, and
      compare the results from both books. And then, I conducted an Natural
      Language Processing and Text Similarity Test to further achieving the
      objective. I hope the result shows the fact that whether the two books are
      strongly similar since both of them are from the same author and has the
      same main character-Sherlock Holmes. I also want to have some insights
      regarding the writing styles of Aurthur Conan Doyle, in terms of tones and
      commonly used words.
    </p>
    <h3>Implementation</h3>
    <p>
      To start the project, I decided to use two books from the Project
      Gutenberg then I process the file to make sure the actual content of the
      book is used for later analyze by excluding headers,limiting spaces,
      changing words to lower cases.. I started doing the basic analysis by
      getting the total words from both books to have a general sense of both
      books and to ensure that I am not comparing an extremely long book with a
      short book. Then, I did some analysis on the most common words from each
      book and compare their similarity and differences. Furthermore, after
      having a general sense of both books, I did natural language processing to
      have some insights on the writing styles of Arthur Conan Doyle, positive,
      negative or neutral? Followed by this, I decided to do a text similarity
      test instead of further the sentiment analysis because I believe comparing
      two books is the top priority of the project, plus the previous analysis
      on the most common words in each book gave interesting overlapping words.
      And thus, a text similarity test was used to generate more insight on the
      main objective.
    </p>

    <h3>Results</h3>

    <p>
      Before analyzing the two books, I first ensure these two books are great
      options for comparison and analyzing the writing styles by checking the
      numbers of words in each book. The result shows that
      <i>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes </i> has 107591 words, and
      <i>The Return of Sherlock Holmes</i> has 113642 words. Since they have
      similar numbers of words, further analysis are completed as following
    </p>
    <p>
      The first objective of the project is to find the writing style of Arthur
      Conan Doyle by doing a sentiment analysis. Based on the result of the
      sentiment analysis, Overall, both books have very similar sentiments. But
      there are slightly differences- <i>The Return of Sherlock Holmes</i> can
      be perceived as having more sentimental words than
      <i>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes </i> because the former has higher
      results in both negative and positive words than the later. I believe this
      is an interesting result because Arthur Conan Doyle was 'forced' by his
      audience to write <i>The Return of Sherlock Holmes</i> after he decided to
      end the series by 'killing' Sherlock Holmes, which may create a deeper
      bond between him and Sherlock Holmes and evoking both positive and
      negative sentiment while writing, instead of writing the book on an
      completely objective way.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second objective of the project is to find the similarity and
      differences between two books. Based on the result of analyzing top 10
      common words in both books. There are eight words are the overlapping
      words in the top 10 common words in two books. They are ['said', 'holmes',
      'man', 'mr', 'now', 'see', 'well', 'us'] The result surprised me because I
      did not expect that there are eight overlapping words. The result also
      surprised me that the word 'watson' only appeared 210 times in
      <i>The Return of Sherlock Holmes</i> and is not even the top 10 most
      common words in <i>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes </i>. Also the
      frequency of the word 'holmes' doubled in the
      <i>The Return of Sherlock Holmes</i>. I assume the huge discrepancy is due
      to the fact that audiences hope to see more interactions between Sherlock
      Holmes and John Watson. But more research is required to make the
      assumption, such as fully investigate the opinions of audiences at that
      time and analyzing other books from Aurthur, which is not within the scope
      of this project. But I hope this research is a solid and helpful
      foundation for more in depth research on Arthur Conan Doyle and his books.
      Since two books have the same eight overlapping words in top ten most
      common words, I decided to further analyze the similarity of two books
      using the fuzz ratio. However, the result shows that there is only 1%
      similarity between two books.

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>
      Overall, I believe the project went well. The project is appropriately
      scoped, since I am able to generate interesting results for both of my
      objectives and create a project that is meaningful for further study on
      Arthur Conan Doyle and his books by providing a clear direction. I also
      had a good plan for testing by consistently print results to check if they
      are my desired results.I learned alot from this project by utilizing what
      I learned in classes and implemented them into actual projects. I also
      love learning new techniques, such as the Natural Language Processing and
      the fuzz ratio. Going forward, I would love to use these new techniques in
      the future projects. I also learned a lot on the importance of writing out
      the framework and structure before starting to write the actual code.
      However, I understand that there is always room for improvement. I was
      struggling on importing the natural language processing package because my
      python version is not the most up to date one and after I downloaded the
      the most recent version, I still struggled a little bit. And thus, for my
      next project, I will prevent similar situations happen again by checking
      everything before I started the project to avoid inefficiency.
